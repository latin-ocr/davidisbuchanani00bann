134 APPENDIX.

Lords, albeit with the great grief and opposition of the better pairtie in both
Houses‚ to vote these papers false and scandalous, and as such to be burnt by the
hand of the hangman; the publissier, Mr. Buchanan, to be ane incendarie
betwixt the two nations‚ and a declaration to be made for undeceaving os the
people. In all this they knew none of uS‚ they grounded the offence on the
preface and introduction‚ not on our papers themselfe, so we held our peace,
The burning of the papers, and the House of Commons declaration, very ssie
and cunning, hes not yet done much prejudice to us, only it has made the
extraordinar malice and pride of some men ssiyne more clearly. Mr. Buchanan

is gone to a place safe enough; if he corne among yovv‘, he is a man worthy of

great honour for many good services.

11.—FROM NICOLSON'S SCOTTISH HISTORICAL LIBRARY.

The Theatrum Scodae, in Bleau's Atlas, desen-es to be separately remember'd.
This was mostly compil'd by the excellent Sir Robert Gordon of Stralogh‚ at the
request of the foremention'd great undertaker os that general body of geography;
but first begun at the expence of Sir John Scot, of Seots-Tarvet‚ DireAElor of the
Chaneery; who encourag'd Timothy Pont (as shall be observ'd anon) in the survey
of the whole kingdom. After Pont’s death, his maps and papers were sent to Gordon;
who, with his son J ames, survey'd several parts of the nation not medled with before.
Sir John procur'd also for them an order of the General Affembly, direcsting such
ministers as they desir'd to be aiding to them in the accounts of their respective
{hiresz and from hence it was that they were furnish'd with materials for those
admirable descriptions which are now printed with the forty-fix maps of that
noble work. There are not, indeed, so many of 'em of Stralogh's own eom-
posure as we could wish there were; that learned and loyal person having been
a good while incapacitated‚ for the due carrying on of his undertaking, by the
iniquity of the times. Upon which, he devolv'd it on D. Buchanan; who had
revis'd a great deal of the first projeC’oed draughts: but his life ended before
the troubles; and he only finish'd a very few of the county-descriptions.* P. 17.

⁴ In the Bannatyne Miscellany, vol. ii. p. 389, may be found a Latin description of the city οξ
Effluburgh, ascribed to David Buchanan.
