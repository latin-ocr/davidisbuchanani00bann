APPENDIX. 135

The conelufion of this animadverfion* {hews that Master David himself de-
sign“d to write a history of the Scotch affairs; and, to make room for this, it
was necessary to let the world know that George, as well as his neighbours, had
his failings. Ι know not whether he ever went any farther that a bare draught of
some chapters, relating to the better understanding of the antiquities and prime state
of the nation; having rank'd some collections under several heads of that nature,
which he did not live to bring into perfect form. Such papers I have seen; and
they discover their author's fkill in the Hebrew and Celtic languages, to have been
much, more considerable than his acquaintance with the Greek and Roman writers,

who are never to be made friends with some of his opinions and etymologies. Ρ. 120,

III.-—EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM SIR ROBERT SIBBALI)
TO THE REV. ROBERT WODROW.

Edinburgh, April 24, 1702.-The Historia Literaria is done by mc alone.
I hope I may have your and some gentlernens here, their affistance in the
reviling and correcting of it. I have finissied the part till the Seculum
decimum sextum (some 60 sheets in my writt) except the historiam, which I
delayed till Ι gotte the archdeacons booke‚ and I ame now confidering it, and
writting the historie of them. I give some account of their lives and ther cha-
ra&ers‚ so well as I may from records: it is most from manuscripts. The sixteen
and 17 secula I did last winter: a good part of them, the account of the writters
of divinity‚ was done in our language for me by the Revd. Mr. Lawrence Char-
ters to the yeer 1700. He giveth the characters of severall of them.† l had

“ ¹⁶ Quare nonnulla prorsus intacta reliquit, {le aliis parum egit, de nonnullis obscure :cripsit;
de quibus omnibus, prout nascetur occasio, nohis erit dicendum.” Nicolson quotes some manuscript
noteS‚ in the possession of Sir Robert Sibbald. See his Commentarius in Vitam Georgii
Buchanani, ab ipsomet scriptam, p. 57. Edinb. 1702, 8v0. Sibbald here mentions that he was
descended from the same family as George Buchanan; ‘⁶ David Buchananus‚ ex eadem familia
oriundus ;'' but we cannot discover his authority for such a statement- A student named David
Buchanan was admitted of St. Leonard's College at St. Andrews in the year 1610. His identity with
the author of the present volume may perhaps be inferred, but cannot easily be proved.

Account of Scots Divines has been recently printed in a collection bearing the general title οἵ (Ῑαῐπῐοςυυκ
