† This date of the testator's death agrees with the statement of Archbishop Nicolson, who informs
us that the life of David Buchanon ended before the troubles os the kingdom, or, in other words, that
he died before the restoration. In the prefuce to Truth its Manifest, the author speaks of himself
in the following terms: ‘¹ He heartily blesseth God, who, in his fatherly care towards him hitherto
(and he hopes will do so to the end, being assured that he, who giveth the principall, will not deny
the aceessury, if he thinks it fit for his own glory and our good) hath provided for him wherewith
to sustain his nature, without great excesso or much want, and bath schooled him both by precept
and practice, to live and be contentos little; and so, not being so urged bya neer nipping necessity,
or imaginary poverty, as to sell or betray the truth sor a morsell of bread, nor so led away with
the exorbitant desire os prefer-ment or profit, as to cog in upon any terms by flattery, lying, and
fajning with those in whose hands the distribution of such things is amongst us fot the present;
he dare be bold to speak home to the point, and tell down-right the truth of things, according
‘to his best informatkm, wherein the church and state are so much cormerned‚ not feming to be
crossed in his private interest, and put back from his hopes, by displeasing the gods, yet without
giving just occasion of offence to any. Moreover, he preferreth the possessing of himself with
calm and freedom of spirit, having bis little viaticum, such as it is, simple and coarse, to the glister-
ing slavery, with toiling and moiling, of ambitious and covetous ones3 to whatsoever hight with
lusti-e and fair shew they attain unto, in the eyes of the world and opinion of men, knowing that
it is dear bought, with losse of time, and often of eredit and conscience, and to be nothing but a
meer shadow, which in a moment vanisheth.'‘
